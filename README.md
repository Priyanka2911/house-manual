# House Manual#

At the direction of the Committee on Rules within the United States House of Representatives, the Government Publishing Office (GPO), the House Parliamentarian, and the Clerk of the House are making the 114th House Rules and the House Manual available in XML format using the United States Legislative Markup schema through GPO’s Federal Digital System (FDsys), govinfo, and Bulk Data repository.     

The files are being released for comment prior to release through GPO’s Federal Digital System (FDsys), govinfo, and Bulk Data repository.  In early April, the Bulk Data repository for this information will be available at https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/bulkdata/HMAN.

The 112th and 113th House Rules are currently in development. 

The House Manual and House Rules XML releases have been created to reflect existing printed and published documents and might contain typographical errors that exist in those original documents.
